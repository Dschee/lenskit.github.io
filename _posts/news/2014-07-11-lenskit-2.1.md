We are pleased to announce the release of LensKit 2.1.  This is the first
significant feature update in the LensKit 2.0 series, and has many new
features, bug fixes, and performance improvements.

A few highlights:

-   The `lenskit-all` module is now available, depending on the other LensKit
    modules, so you can pull in all of LensKit with a single dependency.

-   The evaluator can now automatically share common components (e.g.
    similarity matrices) between multiple configurations, resulting in much
    higher throughput for large evaluation experiments..

-   Saved recommender engines can be reconnected to a different database when
    they are loaded.

-   LensKit now uses Gradle to handle its build process.

-   LensKit is now at <http://lenskit.org> and its GitHub page is moved to
    <http://github.com/lenskit/lenskit>.

See the [release notes](/releases/lenskit-2.1.html) for more details.
