# Building Applications with LensKit

You'd like to build an application that uses LensKit to provide recommendations? Great!

The first thing you probably want to read is our [Getting Started
guide](/documentation/basics/getting-started/).  It describes how to create a simple
Java application that uses LensKit to build a model and produce
recommendations.

Then, you will likely want to consult the rest of our
[documentation](/documentation/) to read about how to
[configure](/documentation/basics/configure/) your recommender, the [usual
pieces](/documentation/basics/structure/) of a recommender, the [algorithms](/documentation/algorithms/) LensKit provides, and more.

See the [list of LensKit users](/users/) for inspiration.
