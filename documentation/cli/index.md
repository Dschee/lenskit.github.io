[dl]: /download/

The [LensKit binary distribution][dl] contains a command line tool, `lenskit`,
for performing various LensKit operations.  Each operation is exposed as a
subcommand, much like `git` or `hg` uses, with its own manual page:

- [lenskit](./lenskit.1.html) (the main tool)
- [lenskit-version](./lenskit-version.1.html)
- [lenskit-eval](./lenskit-eval.1.html)
- [lenskit-grain-model](./lenskit-grain-model.1.html)
- [lenskit-predict](./lenskit-predict.1.html)
- [lenskit-recommend](./lenskit-predict.1.html)
- [lenskit-graph](./lenskit-graph.1.html)
- [lenskit-pack-ratings](./lenskit-pack-ratings.1.html)
