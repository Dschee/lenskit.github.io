# Recommender Algorithms

LensKit provides ready-to-use implementations of several recommender
algorithms:

- [Item-based CF](item-item)
- [User-based CF](user-user)
- [Matrix factorization](svd)
- [Slope-One](slope-one)

The [recommender structure](../basics/structure/) documentation describes the
components common to all algorithms.
