## Evaluator

[SimpleEvaluator]: /apidocs/org/grouplens/lenskit/eval/traintest/SimpleEvaluator.html

-   **Incompatible change:** the default holdout for `addDataset` methods on
    [SimpleEvaluator][] is now the same as the default on `CrossfoldTask`
    (fixed holdout of 10, instead of the 20% previously used).  This change was
    made to make `SimpleEvaluator` and `CrossfoldTask` have consistent
    defaults.
